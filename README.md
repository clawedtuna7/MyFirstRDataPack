# MyFirstRDataPack

For this lab, I tried to create my own R package, one that included an old data set from GIS 2. I was not able to successfully complete this package, but am publishing it for the sake of completion. 

The tutorial was decent, it skipped some steps here and there, but I was ultimately able to figure out (most) of the steps I was supposed to take to go through the lab. What made it difficult was my system. I kept on getting error messages saying that some of the crucial packages I needed to create an r package were "not available for my version of R" (so close to the finish line too!), so I will be checking these things out as I go on to create a package for my final project, and hope that everything works by then.
